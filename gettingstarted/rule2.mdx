## The second rule of building with Ultravox: "It's all prompting".
Yeah. Prompting is really important.

Complicated interactions between your agent and users might need to be broken up into multiple call stages to help keep the most important instructions and tasks in focus.

Check out our [prompting guide](/gettingstarted/prompting) for more.
