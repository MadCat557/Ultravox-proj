## The third rule of building with Ultravox: "There is no ASR".
Ultravox understands speech directly. There is no automatic speech recognition (ASR) stage in the pipeline.

Context matters. We want Ultravox to hear the world as we hear it. This makes Ultravox faster and better at understanding than other systems that rely on ASR and speech to text.
