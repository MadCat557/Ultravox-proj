## Overview

The Ultravox API allows you to create AI-powered voice applications that can interact with regular phone numbers. This enables Ultravox AI agents to make outgoing calls and receive incoming calls from traditional phone networks.

:::note[Twilio Support]
We currently integrate with Twilio. Please let us know if there's another integration you'd like to see.
:::

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using the Ultravox API with Twilio for both outgoing and incoming phone calls.

## Creating a Phone Call with Twilio
:::tip[Prerequisites]
Make sure you have:
1. An active Twilio account
1. A phone number purchased from Twilio
:::

Creating an Ultravox call that works with Twilio is just like creating a WebRTC call, but there are two parameters to the [Create Call](./api/calls/#create-call) command worth special attention:

<table class="w-full">
    <tr class="w-full">
        <th class="w-1/12"></th>
        <th class="w-1/12"></th>
        <th class="w-10/12"></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="font-mono">medium</td>
        <td>object</td>
        <td>Tells Ultravox which protocol to use. <br />For Twilio, must be set to `{"twilio": {}}` and sets the call to use Twilio [Media Streams](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/media-streams). Defaults to `{"webRtc": {}}` which sets the protocol to WebRTC.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="font-mono">initiator</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>Tells Ultravox who is responsible for starting the call. For outgoing calls, typically set to `"agent"`. Default is `"user"`.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Adding these to the request body when creating the call would look like this:

```javascript
{
  "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful assistant...",
  ...
  "medium": {
    "twilio": {}
  },
  "initiator": "agent"
}
```

Ultravox will return a `joinUrl` that can then be used with Twilio for outgoing or incoming calls.

## Outgoing Calls

It only takes two steps to make an outgoing call to regular phone numbers through Twilio:
<Steps>
1. **Create an Ultravox Call** → Create a new call (see [above](#creating-a-phone-call-with-twilio)), and get a `joinUrl`.

1. **Initiate Twilio Phone call** → Use the `joinUrl` with a Twilio [`<Stream>`](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/stream).

    ```javascript
    // Example using the twilio node library
    const call = await client.calls.create({
        twiml: `<Response>
                    <Connect>
                        <Stream url="${joinUrl}"/>
                    </Connect>
                </Response>`,
        to: phoneNumber, // the number you are calling
        from: twilioPhoneNumber // your twilio number
    });
    ```
</Steps>

See the [twilio-outgoing-call](https://github.com/fixie-ai/ultradox/tree/main/examples/twilio-outgoing-call) example for more.

This example shows one of the many options Twilio provides for making outgoing calls. Consult the [Twilio docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs) for more details.

## Incoming Calls
Incoming calls require essentially the same two steps as outgoing calls:

<Steps>
1. **Create an Ultravox Call** → Create a new call (see [above](#creating-a-phone-call-with-twilio)), and get a `joinUrl`. *Note: for incoming calls you will want to keep `initiator` set to the default ("user").*

1. **Receive Inbound Twilio Phone call** → Use the `joinUrl` with a Twilio [`<Stream>`](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/stream).

    ```xml
    <!-- Example using a TwiML Bin -->
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response>
        <Connect>
            <Stream url="your_ultravox_join_url" />
        </Connect>
    </Response>

    ```
</Steps>

The above shows how to create a TwiML Bin and use that for handling the inbound call. Consult the [Twilio docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs) for more on all the options Twilio provides for handling phone calls.


## Conclusion

By integrating the Ultravox API with Twilio, you can create powerful AI-driven voice applications that interact with regular phone networks. This opens up a wide range of possibilities for customer service, automated outreach, and other voice-based AI applications.
