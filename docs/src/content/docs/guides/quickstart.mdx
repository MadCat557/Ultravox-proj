Creating your first voice-powered AI agent with Ultravox is easy.
This guide will walk you through the process of creating a simple voice-enabled AI agent.

There are three main steps to building a voice-enabled AI agent with the Ultravox API:

<Steps>
1. **Create a Call** → Construct a `systemPrompt` and choose a `voice` for your AI agent. This returns a `joinUrl` that you use to start the call.

1. **Start the Call** → Using the `joinUrl` from the previous step, start the call which starts a speech-to-speech conversation with your AI agent.

1. **End the Call** → When the conversation is complete, end the call to stop the conversation.
</Steps>

## Create a Call
The first step is to create a call. This is done by doing a `POST` to the `/calls` endpoint. Here is what that looks like:

This returns the following response:

The `joinUrl` will be used in the next step.


```terminal
curl --location 'https://api.ultravox.ai/api/calls' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-API-Key: ••••••' \
--data '{
    "systemPrompt": "You are an expert on speech-to-speech communication.",
    "temperature": 0.8,
}'
```
## Start the Call
TODO

## End the Call
TODO

## TODO
```javascript
console.log('Hello world.');
```

```python
print("Hello world.")
```
