:::note[API Key Required]
The Ultravox API (and the completion of this Quickstart) requires an API key.

Creating your first voice-powered AI agent with Ultravox is easy.
This guide will walk you through the process of creating a simple voice-enabled AI agent.

There are three main steps to building a voice-enabled AI agent with the Ultravox API:

<Steps>
1. **[Create a Call](#create-a-call)** → Construct a `systemPrompt` and choose a `voice` for your AI agent. This returns a `joinUrl` that you use to join the call.

1. **[Join the Call](#join-the-call)** → Using the `joinUrl` from the previous step, join the call which starts a speech-to-speech conversation with your AI agent.

1. **[End the Call](#end-the-call)** → When the conversation is complete, end the call to stop the conversation.
</Steps>

### Create a Call
The first step is to create a call. This is done by doing a `POST` to the [`/calls`](../../api-reference/operations/calls_create) endpoint. This call should be made from a server to prevent accidentally leaking your API key on the client. Here is what that looks like:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.ultravox.ai/api/calls' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-API-Key: ••••••' \
--data '{
    "systemPrompt": "You are an expert on speech-to-speech communication.",
    "temperature": 0.8,
}'
```

This returns the following response:

```json
{
    "callId": "9b74f1aa-0802-4198-a5f3-cfa89871aebb",
    "created": "2024-08-12T18:47:22.365692Z",
    "ended": null,
    "model": "fixie-ai/ultravox",
    "systemPrompt": "You are an expert on speech-to-speech communication.",
    "temperature": 0.8,
    "voice": null,
    "languageHint": null,
    "joinUrl": "wss://voice...app/calls/9b74f1aa-0802-4198-a5f3-cfa89871aebb"
}
```

We will ignore `voice` and `languageHint` for now.

The `joinUrl` will be used in the next step.

### Join the Call
Now that we have a `joinUrl`, we can use the `ultravox-client` in our application to join the call. The `ultravox-client` is available for multiple languages. More info on the [SDK](/sdk/) page.

We need to reference the `ultravox-client` in our front-end, create an `UltravoxSession`, and then call the `joinCall` method:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { UltravoxSession } from 'https://unpkg.com/ultravox-client/dist/esm/session.js?module';
  let UVSession = new UltravoxSession();
  const joinUrl = "wss://voice...app/calls/9b74f1aa-0802-4198-a5f3-cfa89871aebb" // From the POST to /calls
  UVSession.joinCall(joinUrl);
</script>
```

### End the Call
When the call is over, simply use the `endCall()` method on the `UltravoxSession` object:

```javascript
UVSession.leaveCall();
```

## Examples
There are some [`examples`](https://github.com/fixie-ai/ultradox/tree/main/examples/) you can fork and run.
