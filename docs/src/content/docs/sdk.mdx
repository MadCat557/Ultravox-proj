The Ultravox [REST API](../api/auth/) is used to create calls but you must use one of the Ultravox client SDKs to join and end calls. This page primarily uses examples in JavaScript. The concepts are the same across all the [different SDK implementations](#sdk-implementations).

## Ultravox Session
The core of the SDK is the `UltravoxSession`. The session is used to join and leave calls.

<Tabs syncKey="example-language">
  <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { UltravoxSession } from 'ultravox-client';

    const session = new UltravoxSession();
    const state = await session.joinCall('wss://your-call-join-url');

    session.leaveCall();
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Flutter">
    ```dart
    import 'package:ultravox_client/ultravox_client.dart';

    UltravoxSession session = UltravoxSession.create();
    UltravoxSessionState state = await _session.joinCall('wss://your-call-join-url');

    await session.leaveCall();
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    import ai.ultravox.UltravoxSession

    val session = UltravoxSession()
    val state = session.joinCall("wss://your-call-join-url")

    session.leaveCall()
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Python">
    ```python
    import asyncio
    import ultravox_client as uv

    session = uv.UltravoxSession()
    state = await session.join_call("wss://your-call-join-url")

    await session.leave_call()
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Methods
The `UltravoxSession` contains methods for:
* Joining/leaving a call
* Sending text messages to the agent
* Changing the output medium for how the agent replies
* Registering client tools
* Muting the microphone/speaker

#### joinCall()

```typescript
joinCall(joinUrl: string): UltravoxSessionState
```
Joins a call. Requires a joinUrl (string). Returns an [`UltravoxSessionState`](#ultravox-session-state).

#### leaveCall()

```typescript
async leaveCall(): Promise<void>
```
Leaves the current call. Returns a promise (with no return value) that resolves when the call has successfully been left.

#### sendText()

```typescript
sendText(text: string): void
```
Sends a message to the model. Model replies via text transcript. Requires inputting the text message (string).

#### registerToolImplementation()
```ts
registerToolImplementation(name: string, implementation: ClientToolImplementation): void
```
Registers a client tool implementation with the given name. If the call is started with a client-implemented tool, this implementation will be invoked when the model calls the tool.

| parameter        | description                                 |
|----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| name | String. The name of the tool. Must match what is defined in `selectedTools` during [call creation](../api/calls/#create-call). If `nameOverride` is set then must match that name. Otherwise must match `modelToolName`. |
| implementation | `ClientToolImplementation` function that implements the tool's logic. |

**`ClientToolImplementation`**

This is a function that:

**Accepts `parameters`** → An object containing key-value pairs for the tool's parameters. The keys will be strings.

**Returns** → Either a string result, or an object with a result string and a responseType, or a Promise that resolves to one of these.

For example:

```js
  const stock_price = (parameters) => {
    ...  // to be implemented
    return `Stock price is ${value}`;
  };
```

#### registerToolImplementations()
```ts
registerToolImplementations(implementationMap: { [name: string]: ClientToolImplementation }): void 
```
Convenience batch wrapper for registerToolImplementation.

**`implementationMap`** → An object where each key (a string) represents the name of the tool and each value is a `ClientToolImplementation` function.

#### isMicMuted()

```typescript
isMicMuted(): boolean
```
Returns a boolen indicating if the end user's microphone is muted. This is scoped to the Ultravox SDK and does not detect muting done by the user outside of your application.

#### isSpeakerMuted()

```typescript
isSpeakerMuted(): boolean
```
Returns a boolen indicating if the speaker (the agent's voice output) is muted. This is scoped to the Ultravox SDK and does not detect muting done by the user outside of your application.


#### muteMic()

```typescript
muteMic(): void
```
Mutes the end user's microphone. This is scoped to the Ultravox SDK.

#### unmuteMic()

```typescript
unmuteMic(): void
```
Unmutes the end user's microphone. This is scoped to the Ultravox SDK.


#### muteSpeaker()

```typescript
muteSpeaker(): void
```
Mutes the end user's speaker (the agent's voice output). This is scoped to the Ultravox SDK.


#### unmuteSpeaker()

```typescript
unmuteSpeaker(): void
```
Unmutes the end user's speaker (the agent's voice output). This is scoped to the Ultravox SDK.


## Client Tools
Ultravox has robust support for [tools](../tools). The SDK has support for client tools. Client tools will be invoked in your client code and enable you to add interactivity in your app that is driven by user interactions with your agent. For example, your agent could choose to invoke a tool that would trigger some UI change.

### Creating Client Tools
Client tools are defined just like "server" tools with three exceptions:

#### 1. "client" not "http"
You don't add the URL and HTTP method for client tools. Instead, you add `"client": {}` to the tool definition.

import tempToolClient from '../codesnippets/temp-tool-client.txt?raw';
export const titleClient = "Using a Client Tool"
export const linesClient = [19];

<Code code={tempToolClient} lang="js" title={titleClient} mark={linesClient} />

import tempTool from '../codesnippets/temp-tool.txt?raw';
export const title = "Using a Server Tool"
export const lines = [19, 20, 21, 22];

<Code code={tempTool} lang="js" title={title} mark={lines} />

#### 2. Client Registration
Your client tool must be registered in your client code. Here's a snippet that might be found in client code to register the client tool and implement the logic for the tool.

See [SDK Methods](#registertoolimplementation) for more information.

import clientToolReg from '../codesnippets/client-tool-registration.txt?raw';
export const ctTitle = "Registering a Client Tool"

<Code code={clientToolReg} lang="js" title={ctTitle} />

#### 3. Only Body Parameters
Unlike server tools (which accept parameters passed by path, header, body, etc.), client tools only allow parameters to be passed in the body of the request. That means client tools will always have parameter location set like this:

```js
"location": "PARAMETER_LOCATION_BODY"
```


## Ultravox Session State
When a call is joined, an `UltravoxSessionState` is returned. This object returns the current status, can be used to get text transcripts of the call, and surfaces debug messages that are helpful when building your application.

### Status
The session status is based on the `UltravoxSessionStatus` enum and can be one of the following:

| status        | description                                 |
|-------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| disconnected | Session is not connected. This is the initial state prior to joinCall. |
| disconnecting | Session is in the process of disconnecting. |
| connecting    | Session is establishing the connection.     |
| idle          | Session is connected but not yet active.      |
| listening     | Listening to the end user.                  |
| thinking      | The model is processing/thinking.           |
| speaking      | The model is speaking.                      |

#### Status Events
The status can be retrieved by adding an event listener to the state. Building on what we did above:

<Tabs syncKey="example-language">
  <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    // Listen for status changing events
    state.addEventListener('ultravoxSessionStatusChanged', (event) => {
      console.log('Session status changed: ', event.state);
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Flutter">
    ```dart
    state.addListener(() {
      print('Status is now ${state.status}');
    })
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Transcripts
Sometimes you may want to augment the audio with text transcripts (e.g. if you want to show the end user the model's output in real-time). Transcripts can be retrieved by adding an event listener to state:

```javascript
import { UltravoxSession } from 'ultravox-client';

const session = new UltravoxSession();
const state = await session.joinCall('wss://your-call-join-url');

// Listen for transcripts changing events
state.addEventListener('ultravoxTranscriptsChanged', (event) => {
  console.log('Transcripts updated: ', event.transcripts);
  console.log('Current session status: ', event.state); // Session status is also available on the event
});

session.leaveCall();
```

Transcripts are an array of transcript objects. Each transcript has the following properties:

| property | type    | definition                                                                                                                |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| text     | string  | Text transcript of the speech from the end user or the agent.                                                             |
| isFinal  | boolean | True if the transcript represents a complete utterance. False if it is a fragment of an utterance that is still underway. |
| speaker  | Role    | Either "user" or "agent". Denotes who was speaking.                                                                       |
| medium   | Medium  | Either "voice" or "text". Denotes how the message was sent.                                                               |

### Debug Messages
:::danger[No Guarantee]
Debug messages from Ultravox should be treated as debug logs. They can change regularly and don't have a contract. Relying on the specific structure or content should be avoided.
:::
The state object also provides debug messages. Debug messages must be enabled when creating the `UltravoxSession` and then are available via an event listener similar to status and transcripts:

```javascript
import { UltravoxSession } from 'ultravox-client';

const debugMessages = new Set(["debug"]);
const session = new UltravoxSession({ experimentalMessages: debugMessages });
const state = await session.joinCall('wss://your-call-join-url');

// Listen for debug messages
state.addEventListener('ultravoxExperimentalMessage', (msg) => {
  console.log('Got a debug message: ', JSON.stringify(msg));
});

session.leaveCall();
```

#### Debug Message:  Tool Call
When the agent invokes a tool, the message contains the function, all arguments, and an invocation ID:
```bash
LLM response: Tool calls: [FunctionCall(name='createProfile', args='{"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Burgandy","organization":"Fixie.ai","useCase":"creating a talking AI news reporter"}', invocation_id='call_D2qQVS8OQc998aMEw5PRa9cF')]
```

#### Debug Message:  Tool Call Result
When the tool call completes, the message contains an array of messages. Multiple tools can be invoked by the model. This message array will conatain all the calls followed by all the results. These messages are also available via [List Call Messages](../api/calls/#list-call-messages).

Here's an example of what we might see from a single tool invocation:

```bash
Tool call complete.

Result: [
  role: MESSAGE_ROLE_TOOL_CALL ordinal: 6 text: "{\"firstName\":\"Ron\",\"lastName\":\"Burgandy\",\"organization\":\"Fixie.ai\",\"useCase\":\"creating a talking AI news reporter\"}" tool_name: "createProfile" invocation_id: "call_D2qQVS8OQc998aMEw5PRa9cF" tool_id: "aa737e12-0989-4adb-9895-f387f40557d8" ,
  role: MESSAGE_ROLE_TOOL_RESULT ordinal: 7 text: "{\"firstName\":\"Ron\",\"lastName\":\"Burgandy\",\"emailAddress\":null,\"organization\":\"Fixie\",\"useCase\":\"creating a talking AI news reporter\"}" tool_name: "createProfile" invocation_id: "call_D2qQVS8OQc998aMEw5PRa9cF" tool_id: "aa737e12-0989-4adb-9895-f387f40557d8"
]
```
