`initiator` is being removed as an option when [creating a call](/api/calls/#create-call).

It has been replaced with `firstSpeaker`.

## Why Change?
`initiator` was confusing as it was used to indicate who was responsible for starting the call (`INITIATOR_USER` or `INITIATOR_AGENT`). It was set to agent for any outgoing calls or left as the default (user) for in-bound calls.

`firstSpeaker` more clearly indicates who speaks first during the call. For inbound calls, the default (`FIRST_SPEAKER_AGENT`) will have the agent answer the call. For outgoing calls, setting it to `FIRST_SPEAKER_USER` indicates the expectation that most people answer a phone call with "Hello?".

## How to Migrate
* Stop using `initiator` when creating any new calls with Ultravox.
* For in-bound calls, you don't need to do anything else unless you expect the user to speak first.
* For out-bound calls, set `firstSpeaker` to `FIRST_SPEAKER_USER`.

Note: If you use `FIRST_SPEAKER_AGENT` for out-bound calls, the first part of the agent's utterance might be clipped due to delays in the phone network.
