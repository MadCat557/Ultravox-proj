## Intro
The Ultravox API enables developers to build speech-to-speech AI applications. Built on the open source [Ultravox LLM](https://github.com/fixie-ai/ultravox), the Ultravox API provides a simple REST API for creating calls with AI agents.


## Ultravox REST API
We expect most applications to have a backend that will use the Ultravox REST API to create calls (and secure the API key).

The Ultravox API base url is `http://api.ultravox.ai`.

The API requires an API key and currently provides two endpoints:
* Calls (`/api/calls`)
* Voices (`/api/voices`)

### Authorization
Pass in an API key using the `X-API-Key` header.

### OpenAPI Specification
There is an [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/fixie-ai/ultradox/blob/main/docs/src/content/schemas/ultravox.yml) file available in the repo. This spec is also used to generate the [API Reference](./api-reference/). Additionally, you can use the [Ultravox API Playground](https://api.ultravox.ai/api/schema/swagger-ui/) to quickly explore and test the API.

## Client SDKs 
While there is a RESTful API for Ultravox that is used to create calls, you will need to use one of our client SDKs to join and end calls.

Please let us know if you need a client for a specific language or framework.

## Next steps

<Steps>
1. **Get an API Key** → [Apply for an API Key](https://forms.gle/BNmUBrqymzH3vkxj8).

1. **Do the Quickstart** → [Build](./guides/quickstart/) your first voice-enabled AI agent in minutes.

1. **Read the Docs** → Learn more in [the API Reference](./api-reference).
</Steps>

:::caution[Under Construction]
The Ultravox API is under active development. This means you should expect it to get better, faster, stronger, etc. It also means that things could break.

If you have questions or would like us to change/add something, please reach out on the [Ultravox Discord](https://discord.gg/Qw6KHxv8YB) or [submit an issue or PR](https://github.com/fixie-ai/ultravox).
