## The First Rule of Ultravox: `It's All Prompting`
The first rule of building with Ultravox: It's all prompting. Everything that your agents do is based on the prompt instructions you give them. It's tempting then to write very complicated, verbose prompts. The problem with that approach is that the more instructions we provide in the prompt, the less well the model does at attending to the various instructions.

## The Second Rule of Ultravox: `It's All Prompting`
Yeah. Prompting is really important. When you create and use tools, the names and descriptions you write are visible to the model and should be crafted with care. Complicated interactions between your agent and users might need to be broken up into multiple call stages to help keep the most important instructions and tasks in focus. Check out our [prompting guide](/guides/advancedprompting) for more.

## The Third Rule of Ultravox: `There is no ASR`
Ultravox understands speech directly. There is no automatic speech recognition (ASR) stage in the pipeline. Context matters. We want Ultravox to hear the world as we hear it. This makes Ultravox faster and better at understanding than other systems that rely on ASR and speech to text.

## The Fourth Rule of Ultravox: `Tools are Just Functions`
<ToolsPossibilities />

Versatile? Check. Powerful? Check. Easy to Implement? Check.


## The Fifth Rule of Ultravox: `The Start Call 2-Step`
Calls are the core of Ultravox. A call is an interaction between an agent and an end user.

Calls have two distinct steps:

**Call Creation** → Calls are configured and created using the Ultravox REST API's [/calls](/api-reference/calls/calls-post) endpoint. Creating a call returns a `joinUrl` which is then used to join the call.

**Join Call** → Once created, calls are joined (and ended) using our [client SDK](/sdk-reference/), bridged to from a telephony provider (TODO link), or connected from your server via WebSockets (TODO).

## The Sixth Rule of Ultravox:  `Ultravox Realtime is Fast and Cheap`
We couldn't help ourselves. We had to add one more rule...because this is a promise worth making.

Voice AI only works when conversations feel natural and fluid. No awkward pause.  No lag. Just smooth back-and-forth dialogue that feels human. Ultravox Realtime doesn't just meet this standard—it sets it.

### Speed That Speaks for Itself
Don't take our word for it. See the numbers yourself at [thefastest.ai](https://thefastest.ai/?m=audio), where we publish daily head-to-head comparisons between Ultravox Realtime and other leading platforms. Our benchmarks tell a clear story: when it comes to real-time voice AI, speed matters, and we deliver.

### Enterprise Performance. Consumer Prices.
At just $0.05 per minute, we're making premium voice AI accessible to everyone. Why? Because we believe groundbreaking technology should come with groundbreaking pricing.
No hidden fees. No complex pricing tiers. Just straightforward, affordable rates that let you focus on building amazing voice experiences.
