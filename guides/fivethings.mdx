## The First Rule of Ultravox: It's All Prompting
The first rule of building with Ultravox: It's all prompting. Everything that your agents do is based on the prompt instructions you give them. It's tempting then to write very complicated, verbose prompts. The problem with that approach is that the more instructions we provide in the prompt, the less well the model does at attending to the various instructions.

## The Second Rule of Ultravox: It's All Prompting
Yeah. Prompting is really important. When you create and use tools, the names and descriptions you write are visible to the model and should be crafted with care. Complicated interactions between your agent and users might need to be broken up into multiple call stages to help keep the most important instructions and tasks in focus. Check out our [prompting guide](/guides/advancedprompting) for more.

## The Start Call 2-Step
Calls are the core of Ultravox. A call is an interaction between an agent and an end user. Calls have two distinct steps:

**Call Creation** → Calls are configured and created using the Ultravox REST API's [/calls](/api-reference/calls/calls-post) endpoint. Creating a call returns a `joinUrl` which is then used to join the call.

**Join Call** → Once created, calls are joined (and ended) using our [client SDK](/sdk-reference/), from a telephone (TODO), or from your server via WebSockets (TODO).

## Tools are Power-Ups (and just functions)
Ultravox provides support for tools (AKA function calling). Tools are just functions and can give your agent additional capabilities.

Here are some of the things you can do with tools:
