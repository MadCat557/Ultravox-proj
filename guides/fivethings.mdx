## The First Rule of Ultravox: `It's All Prompting`
The first rule of building with Ultravox: It's all prompting. Everything that your agents do is based on the prompt instructions you give them. It's tempting then to write very complicated, verbose prompts. The problem with that approach is that the more instructions we provide in the prompt, the less well the model does at attending to the various instructions.

## The Second Rule of Ultravox: `It's All Prompting`
Yeah. Prompting is really important. When you create and use tools, the names and descriptions you write are visible to the model and should be crafted with care. Complicated interactions between your agent and users might need to be broken up into multiple call stages to help keep the most important instructions and tasks in focus. Check out our [prompting guide](/guides/advancedprompting) for more.

## The Third Rule of Ultravox: `The Start Call 2-Step`
Calls are the core of Ultravox. A call is an interaction between an agent and an end user. Calls have two distinct steps:

**Call Creation** → Calls are configured and created using the Ultravox REST API's [/calls](/api-reference/calls/calls-post) endpoint. Creating a call returns a `joinUrl` which is then used to join the call.

**Join Call** → Once created, calls are joined (and ended) using our [client SDK](/sdk-reference/), from a telephone (TODO), or from your server via WebSockets (TODO).

## The Fourth Rule of Ultravox: `Tools are Just Functions`
Tools in Ultravox (also known as function calling) are a powerful way to extend your agents' capabilities by connecting them to external services and systems. At their core, tools are simply functions that agents can invoke to perform specific actions or retrieve information.

Any functionality you can encapsulate in a function can be exposed to your agents as a tool. Addtionally, Ultravox automatically calls the underlying function so you don't have to sweat gluing things together.

Versatile? Check. Powerful? Check. Easy to Implement? Check.

Here are some of the things you can do with tools:

## The Fifth Rule of Ultravox: `There is no ASR`
Ultravox understands speech directly. There is no automatic speech recognition (ASR) stage in the pipeline. Context matters. We want Ultravox to hear the world as we hear it. This makes Ultravox faster and better at understanding than other systems that rely on ASR and speech to text.
